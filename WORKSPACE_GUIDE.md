## 📊 Workspace File Format

### **Structure Overview**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "workspace",
  "info": {
    "name": "Workspace Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "exportedAt": "2025-01-29T16:45:00.000Z",
    "exportedBy": "Raju's API Client"
  },
  "collections": [...],
  "environments": [...],
  "history": [...],
  "settings": {...}
}
```

### **Key Fields**
- **`type: "workspace"`** - Identifies as workspace file
- **`version`** - Format version for compatibility
- **`collections`** - All your requests and folders
- **`environments`** - All environment variables
- **`history`** - Last 50 requests (to limit file size)

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### **Partial Workspace Import**
If you want to import only specific parts:
1. **Edit the workspace file** in a text editor
2. **Remove unwanted sections** (collections, environments, or history)
3. **Import the modified file**

### **Workspace Merging**
To combine workspaces:
1. **Export current workspace** as backup
2. **Import new workspace** 
3. **Manually re-import** specific collections from backup if needed

### **Version Control**
Track workspace changes:
```bash
# Add workspace files to git
git add *.json

# Commit workspace states
git commit -m "Add development workspace setup"
```

---

## 🛡️ Data Safety Features

### **Confirmation Before Replace**
- **Warning dialog** before replacing existing data
- **Cancel option** to abort import
- **No accidental data loss**

### **Backup Recommendations**
```
📅 Daily: Export workspace at end of day
📅 Weekly: Create versioned backup files  
📅 Before major changes: Export current state
📅 Before team sharing: Create clean workspace
```

### **File Validation**
- **Format validation** - Ensures valid workspace structure
- **Error messages** - Clear feedback on invalid files
- **Safe fallback** - No data corruption on failed imports

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Import Fails**
```
❌ "Invalid workspace file format"
```
**Solution**: 
- Check file is valid JSON
- Ensure `"type": "workspace"` and `"version"` fields exist
- Try with `sample-workspace.json` first

### **Large File Sizes**
```
❌ File too large to import
```
**Solution**:
- History is limited to 50 items automatically
- Remove unnecessary collections before export
- Split large workspaces into smaller ones

### **Missing Data After Import**
```
❌ Some collections/environments missing
```
**Solution**:
- Check the workspace file structure
- Verify all required fields are present
- Re-export from source and try again

### **Environment Variables Not Working**
```
❌ {{variable}} not substituting
```
**Solution**:
- Open Environment Manager after import
- Select the correct environment
- Verify variable names match exactly
