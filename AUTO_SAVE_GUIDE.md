# 🔄 Auto-Save & Auto-Load Guide
## Never Lose Your Work Again!

### 🌟 What is Auto-Save?

**Auto-Save** in Raju's API Client automatically saves your complete workspace and restores it when you return - ensuring you never lose your work, even if the browser crashes or you accidentally close the tab!

---

## ✨ Auto-Save Features

### **🔒 Smart Auto-Save Triggers**
- **On Window Close** - Saves when you close the browser tab/window
- **After Data Changes** - Saves 2 seconds after you make changes
- **Periodic Saves** - Saves every 5 minutes if you have data
- **Manual Toggle** - Enable/disable auto-save anytime

### **🔄 Auto-Load on Startup**
- **Seamless Restoration** - Your workspace loads automatically when you open the app
- **Smart Detection** - Only loads if no manual data exists (won't overwrite your work)
- **Visual Confirmation** - Shows notification when workspace is restored

### **💾 What Gets Auto-Saved**
```
📦 Complete Workspace
├── 📚 All Collections (requests & folders)
├── 🌍 All Environments (variables & settings)  
├── 📜 Request History (last 50 requests)
├── 🎯 Active Environment (current selection)
└── ⚙️ Auto-save Settings (preferences)
```

🔒 Auto-save enabled   (top-center, 2 seconds)
⏸️ Auto-save disabled  (top-center, 2 seconds)
```

#### **Save Notifications**
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **First Time Setup**
1. **Auto-save is enabled by default** - No setup needed!
2. **Start working** - Create requests, environments, collections
3. **Watch for notifications** - You'll see "✨ Workspace auto-saved"
4. **Close and reopen** - Your work will be restored automatically

### **Testing Auto-Save**
1. **Create some data** (add a request, environment, etc.)
2. **Wait 2 seconds** - You should see "✨ Workspace auto-saved" 
3. **Close browser tab** completely
4. **Open app again** - You should see "🔄 Previous workspace restored"
5. **Verify your data** is all there!

## 🎯 Auto-Save Behavior

### **When Auto-Save Triggers**
```
🔄 Every 2 seconds after changes
🔄 Every 5 minutes (if data exists)
🔄 When closing browser tab/window  
🔄 When manually requested via API
```

### **What Triggers Changes**
- ✅ Adding/editing requests
- ✅ Creating/modifying collections
- ✅ Adding/editing environments
- ✅ Making API calls (adds to history)
- ✅ Importing collections/workspaces

### **Smart Save Logic**
```
📊 Debounced Saves: Waits 2 seconds after last change
📝 Notification Throttling: Only shows if >30 seconds since last
💾 History Limit: Keeps last 50 requests to manage file size
🎯 Environment Preservation: Saves active environment selection
```

---

## 🛡️ Data Safety & Recovery

### **Multiple Save Locations**
```
📁 Individual Components (manual saves)
├── api-client-history (request history)
├── api-client-collections (collections)
├── api-client-environments (environments)  
└── api-client-active-environment (selection)

📦 Auto-Save Workspace (complete backup)
└── autoSavedWorkspace (complete workspace)
```

### **Recovery Priority**
1. **Auto-Save Data** - If available and auto-save enabled
2. **Manual Data** - Falls back to individual localStorage items
3. **Fresh Start** - Clean state if nothing found

### **Data Integrity**
- **Format Validation** - Ensures saved data is valid before loading
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback if auto-save fails
- **No Data Loss** - Manual saves preserved alongside auto-saves

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### **Disable Auto-Save**
```
When you might want to disable:
- Privacy concerns (shared computer)
- Testing with clean state repeatedly
- Managing storage space carefully
- Working with sensitive data
```

### **Manual Control**
```javascript
// Auto-save setting persists in localStorage
localStorage.getItem('autoSaveEnabled') // "true" or "false"

// Auto-saved workspace location
localStorage.getItem('autoSavedWorkspace') // Complete workspace JSON
```

### **Team Collaboration**
- **Individual Auto-Save** - Each user's browser saves their own work
- **Manual Export** - Use workspace export for sharing with team
- **Import Preference** - Auto-save doesn't interfere with manual imports

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Auto-Save Not Working**
```
❌ Problem: No "auto-saved" notifications
✅ Solutions:
  1. Check auto-save is enabled (green button in header)
  2. Make sure you have data (requests/collections/environments)
  3. Wait 2 seconds after making changes
  4. Check browser console for errors
```

### **Workspace Not Restoring**
```
❌ Problem: Work doesn't restore on app load  
✅ Solutions:
  1. Ensure auto-save was enabled when you saved
  2. Check for existing manual data (has priority)
  3. Clear localStorage and try again
  4. Check browser console for errors
```

### **Too Many Notifications**
```
❌ Problem: Too many "auto-saved" messages
✅ Solution: Notifications are throttled to every 30+ seconds
   This is normal behavior to avoid spam
```

### **Storage Issues**
```
❌ Problem: Browser storage full
✅ Solutions:
  1. Clear old data: localStorage.clear()
  2. Export important workspaces first
  3. History automatically limited to 50 items
  4. Consider disabling auto-save temporarily
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Storage Format**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "auto-workspace",
  "info": {
    "name": "Auto-saved Workspace",
    "description": "Automatically saved workspace data",
    "savedAt": "2025-01-29T16:45:00.000Z",
    "savedBy": "Raju's API Client Auto-Save"
  },
  "collections": [...],
  "environments": [...],
  "history": [...],
  "activeEnvironment": {...},
  "settings": {
    "autoSaveEnabled": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-01-29T16:45:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Debounced Saves** - Prevents excessive saving during rapid changes
- **History Limiting** - Keeps only last 50 requests to manage size
- **Background Operation** - Doesn't block UI during saves
- **Efficient Storage** - JSON compression by browser

### **Browser Compatibility**
- ✅ **Chrome/Edge** - Full support
- ✅ **Firefox** - Full support  
- ✅ **Safari** - Full support
- ✅ **Mobile Browsers** - Basic support (manual refresh required)
